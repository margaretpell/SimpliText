"Managing down operating costs within such a complex technology environment is extremely difficult. Retiring applications that are tightly coupled within the technical and data architecture results in nearly insurmountable dependency management issues and change risk. Seemingly small projects quickly become big, expensive efforts with extended timeframes. Retiring one application inevitably requires upstream and downstream changes and this added cost erodes the business case and often leads to a decision to leave things as they are.","Technology is often not easy to make affordable. Turning off programs that work together might lead to trouble. It can be risky, too. Little projects can become large and costly. If you end a program, you might need to adjust other things, which can be pricey. This is why changes are not made frequently."
"In this editorial for the collection on complexity in mental health research, we introduce and summarize the inaugural contributions to this collection: a series of theoretical, methodological, and empirical papers that aim to chart a path forward for investigating mental health in all its complexity... From physics to ecology, there is a rapidly evolving body of interdisciplinary research dedicated to investigating complex systems.","We give out the first simple stories about keeping your brain healthy. These stories have thoughts, ways to do things, and information. They talk about the hard parts of keeping your brain in good shape. People who know a lot about science and the natural world look into hard subjects. They are creating a space where everyone can learn together."
"Throughout the twentieth century, much of psychiatry aspired to reductionist simplicity... However, far from uncovering simple etiologies, the past century of psychiatric research has revealed systematic complexity, leading to a growing recognition that mental disorders are dauntingly complex phenomena.","In the early 1900s, experts in how the mind works tried to make their work easier to understand. They looked for easy explanations for why people have problems with their feelings and thoughts. Research has shown that issues with our thoughts and feelings can be complicated. Today, more people get how complicated these issues are."
Impulses travel along nerves at a speed called the nerve conduction velocity (NCV). This velocity has been extensively measured in human peripheral nerves because of its utility in clinical medicine. Appreciably decreased NCV can be an important indicator of nerve injury or disease,"Researchers check how fast signals travel through the wires in our bodies. This is known as how quick our nerves are. It's important for looking after our health. When these signals move too slowly, it can show that there might be a problem or sickness in the nerves."
"Social isolation also comes with significant risk of mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, including chronic anxiety and depression. Alongside this complex aetiology, social isolation has been linked to the increased prevalence of substance use disorders across a range of drug types, where social isolation both predicts drug abuse, and drug abuse occurs as a consequence of social isolation. Unfortunately, when socially isolated individuals wish to moderate or quit drug-intake, quitting is more difficult and less successful, limiting the likelihood of a long lasting recovery",Using something too much can hurt you. Being alone a lot can make you feel unhappy. You might get really sad or worried. This could lead to taking too much medicine or bad stuff. Taking too much can make you feel more alone. Stopping or using less can be tough when you're by yourself. People who feel alone might struggle to not use too much medicine or bad stuff.
"The mobile nature of digital games ensures that the lines between in-school and out-of-school gameplay is blurred. Thus, it is important to explore the possibilities of these games to create new spaces for learning and engaging with mathematics. From a social learning perspective, research has been concerned with the ways in which the games industry has been influencing ‘interactive’ learning via computers; creating spaces for students to create their own digital games in order to teach concepts to peers; or the ways in which the games are arranged to motivate learners to engage with the games and engage with higher-order problem solving abilities.",Video games can be taken anywhere. They mix learning with playing. We should look into how they help with learning math. People who know a lot about this are checking out how video games can be good for learning. They see how making games can help kids understand things better. They see if games make kids want to figure out hard puzzles.
"Fritz et al. implement one of the suggestions by Ioannidis et al., using network analysis to study interrelations among psychological and environmental resilience factors for mental health, such as family support and self-esteem, in adolescents with and without child adversity",Fritz and his group research how we feel in our minds. They explore how strong our thoughts can be. They think about how the world around us influences us. They care about how much our families help us. They also care about how good we feel about ourselves. They look into the lives of young people who had hard beginnings. They compare them with young people who didn't have those hard times.
"Mental disorders arise from a host of components across biological, psychological, and social levels of analysis, intertwined in a web of complex interactions... We must go further and understand both the individual components and the complex interactions among them","Some things make our minds feel mixed up. This can happen because of our bodies, what we think, or things that happen to us. They all come together in ways that are hard to understand. We need to notice these things."
"Ethical considerations are crucial in AI and ML, as their usage presents significant concerns around privacy, accountability, and command. The potential for algorithms to perpetuate existing biases, responsibility for AI-generated decisions, and the misuse of AI and ML for malicious purposes like cyberattacks and misinformation are key ethical concerns",We should think about what is right and wrong when using advanced computers. We need to keep our private information safe. People are concerned about who is in charge of these advanced computers. These computers might keep making the same mistakes that are not fair. It's not easy to know who should fix these mistakes. Advanced computers could be used to hurt people on the internet. They can share things that aren't true. These are big questions about what is the right thing to do.
"In his numerous writings, Marx critiques capitalism by identifying its flaws... Only once the working class realizes the flaws of the system, Marx believes, will they - must they - rise up against their bourgeois masters and achieve the necessary and inevitable communist revolution.",Marx points out problems with how businesses work. He shows what's wrong with them. He thinks workers will react to these problems. They will stand up to their rich bosses. This face-off will lead to a big change. Marx thinks this change to a shared way of living is necessary and bound to happen.
"To get a better idea of how lice evolved and spread, a team led by marine biologist Marina S. Ascunce of the University of Florida in Gainesville sequenced the genomes of 463 head lice collected from 38 countries. The researchers found that human head lice belong to two genetically distinct clades, or groups, both of which hitched rides to the Americas on humans.","Marina S. Ascunce researches ocean creatures. She has a job at the University of Florida, which is in a city called Gainesville. She was in charge of a group of researchers. This group looked at the tiny creatures that live in hair from 38 different places around the world. They examined 463 of these creatures. Their goal was to figure out how these tiny creatures changed over time and moved to new areas. The researchers found out that there are two kinds of tiny creature genes. People carried both kinds to North and South America."
"For the last 10 years, the 'Convention of States' movement has sought to remake the Constitution and force a tea party vision of the framers’ intent upon America. This group wants to wholesale rewrite wide swaths of the U.S. Constitution in one fell swoop. In the process, they hope to do away with regulatory agencies like the FDA and the CDC, virtually eliminate the federal government’s ability to borrow money, and empower state legislatures to override federal law.","A group has spent 10 years trying to update important US guidelines. They are fans of the Tea Party movement. They aim to modify a bunch of guidelines all together. They want to get rid of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). They want to cut down on how much money the government owes. They want smaller, community-based organizations to have the power to block laws that apply to the whole country."
"Surgeons have given a man suffering from a debilitating lung condition a new lease of life by using breast implants in an unprecedented procedure. After Davey Bauer from Missouri caught the flu a few months ago, he developed a lung infection that was resistant to antibiotics.","A guy named Davey Bauer from a place called Missouri got really sick with a bad cold that made it hard for him to breathe. His breathing parts inside his body were not working well. The people who help you when you're sick, called doctors, put special pouches in the part of his body under his neck to help him. Even with stuff you take to feel better, called medicine, they couldn't make his sickness go away completely."
"A long-beaked echidna, named after David Attenborough and thought to be extinct, has been rediscovered in the mountains of Indonesia. The long-lost species of mammal is described as having the spines of a hedgehog, the snout of an anteater and the feet of a mole.","Researchers discovered a unique animal with pointy quills and a lengthy snout in the mountains of Indonesia. They named it in honor of David Attenborough, a famous expert on wildlife. It was thought this creature had disappeared for good. It has pointy quills similar to those of a small, round, spiny mammal. It also has an extended snout similar to that of a big-nosed insect-eating mammal. Its paws are great for burrowing, just like the paws of a small, digging mammal."
"The emergence of miniature and micro-products and components is increasingly demanding the production of parts with dimensions in the range of a few tens of nanometers to a few millimeters. Micro-/nano-cutting is one of the key technologies to enable the realization of micro-products, while a great many micro-manufacturing processes have been developed.","Things are getting smaller. Some get much smaller, others just a bit. This makes little things. Chopping things into very small pieces is one way to do it. There are lots of ways to make things tiny."
"Within this structuralist, defense-in-depth approach, safety margins against these scenarios are enforced through conservative regulations of system design and operation, under the creed that the identified worst-case, credible accidents would envelope all credible accidents for what regards the challenges and stresses posed on the system and its protections. The underlying principle has been that if a system is designed to withstand all the worst-case credible accidents, then it is ‘by definition’ protected against any credible accident","This way has simple steps to make and use things without getting hurt. It gets ready for the biggest troubles. If something can deal with the worst troubles, it can deal with any trouble."
"A constant failure rate (CFR) is indicative of externally induced failures, as in the constant hazard rate situation for non-repairable items. A CFR is also typical of complex systems subject to repair and overhaul, where different parts exhibit different patterns of failure with time and parts have different ages since repair or replacement. Repairable systems can show a decreasing failure rate (DFR) when reliability is improved by progressive repair, as defective parts which fail relatively early are replaced by good parts. ‘Burn in’ is applied to electronic systems, as well as to parts, for this purpose.","Things often get damaged on the outside. Stuff might break and sometimes we can't repair it. Even when we repair things, they can still break because their pieces get old and worn out. The pieces don't all get old at the same time. When we repair things, they can be used for a longer time. We put in new pieces when we repair things. Businesses test things that use electricity to make them better."
"It should be noted that, although the system engineering process is applicable in all phases of the life cycle, this is not to imply that any single organizational entity within a given project is responsible for the completion of all of the tasks necessary to accomplish these objectives. The process must be an “inherent” element within any given program structure, and the successful fulfillment of such objectives is dependent on many different organizational groups, working in a cooperative and integrated manner.",Working on the system includes simple steps for each part of the project. It's not just one team's work. Lots of teams need to work together to achieve these goals.
"Thompson and Zhi acknowledge that the AI models are only as good as the data on which they’re trained. There is a lack of racial and geographical diversity in individuals who have had their brains scanned and genomes sequenced, especially in databases such as the UK Biobank, so the findings from this AI-guided research might not be applicable to everyone. Furthermore, Goate says it will be crucial to show that the AI models’ performance can be replicated in other databases, and that they show consistent results.",Thompson and Zhi believe that smart computer programs need accurate information to improve. We don't have enough different pictures of brains and information about people's genes. This problem is important for how the UK gathers health information. The sameness of the data might restrict how helpful smart computer programs can be for everyone. Goate highlights the importance of checking smart computer programs with varied information. She hopes the outcomes from these smart programs can be relied upon.
"Now recall that the underlying LLM’s task, given the dialogue prompt followed by a piece of user-supplied text, is to generate a continuation that conforms to the distribution of the training data, which are the vast corpus of human-generated text on the Internet. What will such a continuation look like? If the model has generalized well from the training data, the most plausible continuation will be a response to the user that conforms to the expectations we would have of someone who fits the description in the preamble. In other words, the dialogue agent will do its best to role-play the character of a dialogue agent as portrayed in the dialogue prompt.","The program keeps talking when a person talks to it. It gets better by getting information from the web. The talk should feel like it's with a real person. If the program works well, it will answer in a way that's easy to understand. The program will copy the way the person who talked first speaks."
"Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival Fatah movement of West Bank-based President Mahmoud Abbas. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment.","In 2006, the group called Hamas got the most votes in the Palestinian elections. The next year, they took charge of a place called Gaza. Another group called Fatah is led by a guy named Mahmoud Abbas, and they run a different area called the West Bank. Gaza and Israel often have violent conflicts. Both Israel and a country next to Gaza called Egypt make it hard for stuff to get into Gaza. They do this because they want to make Hamas weaker and stop them from attacking. Sometimes, Hamas shoots rockets into places where people in Israel live. The people living in Gaza think that Israel is being too strict with the rules that limit what can come into Gaza. They also don't like it when Israel attacks places in Gaza where lots of people live."
"If being a spokesman for a generation is a fleeting occupation, being a symbol of an era is downright dangerous for anyone who has the bad luck to outlive it. In the next few years the expatriate Fitzgerald continued to publish stories about flappers and giddy undergraduates in the Saturday Evening Post even as he struggled with alcohol and Zelda's increasingly unstable mental state. Travelling with Zelda in North Africa in 1930, he wrote about hearing ""a dull distant crash which echoed to the farthest wastes of the desert"".","You may not stay the popular voice of young folks for much longer. Being the symbol of a time period can be uncertain if you've got a lot of life ahead. Fitzgerald traveled to other countries. He told tales about the youth. He struggled with too much alcohol. His wife Zelda had challenges with her mind's health. In 1930, he experienced a big, noisy explosion in the sandy lands of North Africa."
"This despite the fact that I can say (like everyone else on Harvard’s campus in the fall of 2003) that “I was there” at Facebook’s inception, and remember Facemash and the fuss it caused; also that tiny, exquisite movie star trailed by fan-boys through the snow wherever she went, and the awful snow itself, turning your toes gray, destroying your spirit, bringing a bloodless end to a squirrel on my block: frozen, inanimate, perfect—like the Blaschka glass flowers. Doubtless years from now I will misremember my closeness to Zuckerberg, in the same spirit that everyone in ’60s Liverpool met John Lennon.","In 2003, at Harvard, a new website called Facebook started. Everyone was really happy about another website called Facemash. A well-known, not-tall actor attracted a lot of people. Super cold weather made toes turn pale and made people feel sad. A squirrel froze to death close to where I live. The ice-covered squirrel seemed like shiny, delicate flowers you'd see in a place where art and history things are kept. Now and then, I thought I was around the guy who made Facebook, Zuckerberg, but I actually wasn't. It's similar to folks from Liverpool back in the 1960s claiming they bumped into John Lennon."
"Rakesh Khurana has amply shown how this delusion of the charismatic savior creates a dysfunctional market for CEOs, allowing the small number of existing public-company CEOs to demand and receive extravagant compensation. The myth of the generalist CEO is bolstered by the many fawning media portrayals where CEOs say that their key jobs are understanding, hiring, and motivating people—leading board members to believe that you can run a technology company without knowing anything about technology.","Rakesh Khurana believes it's wrong to see a CEO as a super powerful person. Because of this belief, CEOs often get paid a lot. But, not every CEO makes a huge amount of money. Many times, people assume a CEO can manage any kind of company. CEOs are often in the news for guiding groups. So, the people who make decisions think someone can be in charge of a technology company even if they don't know much about technology."
"At first, it’s a solipsistic fantasy—the secret sharer you can tell your troubles to, or that only you understand. Later, it’s rooted in a more philosophical curiosity, the longing to experience the ineffable interiority of some very different being. My eight-year-old daughter says that she wishes the horses she rides could talk, just so she could ask them what it feels like to be a horse. Such a desire presumes—as Thomas Nagel put it in his 1974 essay “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”—that animals have some kind of subjectivity, and that it might somehow be plumbed. ","You want a buddy who you can tell secrets to, someone who really gets you. You imagine what it would be like to be a different kind of living thing. My little girl, who is eight, wishes she could chat with horses. She's curious about life as a horse. Back in 1974, a guy named Thomas Nagel shared his thoughts about this. He was curious about a bat's life. Nagel thought that animals can think and feel stuff. He guessed that we could maybe figure out what they're thinking and feeling."
"I dare say, to deciphering the enigma behind the obsessive, pitch-black fiction. Joseph Heller, the opposite of demonstrative, was given to oblique ways of showing affection….  That was the year Heller published his second novel, “Something Happened,” which Daugherty commends as follows: “Joe stepped beyond Wilson’s sentimentality and Yates’s bitterness to eviscerate modern America’s success ethic.” ","Joseph Heller writes stories that are often sad but good. He expresses love in a calm manner. He put out a new book titled ""Something Happened"" that year. Daugherty enjoys the book. He thinks Heller did better than Wilson at showing feelings and better than Yates at writing in a tough way. Heller wasn't happy with how much America cared about being successful."
"At a certain point, though—to say exactly when would ruin a fairly stunning surprise—the cat-and-mouse psychology is jettisoned in favor of something more procedural. The two halves of “Love Crime” divide according to the words of the title: the first explores the knotty, feverish, ambiguous bond between Christine and Isabelle, while the second is all about guilt, innocence, evidence and motive. It is interesting and ingenious, even if some of the kinky, queasy fascination that had been so intoxicating in the earlier scenes ebbs away.","The film has a surprising change. It starts off with a serious tone. Later, it turns into a mystery. ""Love Crime"" is split into two sections. The first shows how close Christine and Isabelle are. The next part is about a crime. The switch is clever. However, the film becomes less thrilling after the switch."
"If Dickens’s prose fiction has “defects”—excesses of melodrama, sentimentality, contrived plots, and manufactured happy endings—these are the defects of his era, which for all his greatness Dickens had not the rebellious spirit to resist; he was at heart a crowd-pleaser, a theatrical entertainer, with no interest in subverting the conventions of the novel as his great successors D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf would have; nor did he contemplate the subtle and ironic counterminings of human relations in the way of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, who brought to the English novel an element of nuanced psychological realism not previously explored.","Dickens created exciting stories with pretend happy endings that were popular in his time. He aimed to make his readers happy. He didn't do anything new with storytelling. Lawrence, Joyce, and Woolf, however, did try new things. Dickens didn't focus on the feelings or thoughts of his characters as much as Eliot and Hardy did."
"F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby by no means serves as a blanket condemnation of the American dream; instead, the author uses the novel and its upwardly mobile protagonist to celebrate the ability of those not born of wealth to rise to the pinnacle of American society while also examining the costs that can accompany such success. When this duality is understood, the book’s descriptions of the glittering banality of the upper-class lifestyle can be seen as a critique of the hollowness of strictly material success, rather than simply demonstrating that Fitzgerald possessed, as Trilling described it, “a taste for aristocracy.”","""The Great Gatsby"" highlights the good and bad sides of going after a lot of money. Fitzgerald shares a tale about working your way up in society. The book appreciates the opportunity for those who aren't rich yet. It also points out the downsides of trying to become successful. The story suggests that having lots of money might not make you feel fulfilled. Real success isn't only about cash. Fitzgerald doesn't fully look up to rich people."
"For instance, when provided with a pollen-generating food source, bees will develop the capacity to feed on pollen, known as pollinivory; this finding does help to explain the explosion in bee species some 120 million years ago. The study also validates the theory that bees evolved from a species of carnivorous wasps. While pollinivory was confirmed as an important step in the process of bee speciation, the study overturned the previous hypothesis that this factor by itself was the cause of the diversification of bee species.","Bees get their food from the tiny yellow dust in flowers. This yellow dust can tell us stories about bees from a long time ago. Bees have been around for a really, really long time—like 120 million years. In the past, they would eat insects similar to yellow and black striped flying insects. Over time, bees started to eat the yellow dust from flowers instead. Because they changed what they ate, we now have lots of different kinds of bees. People who study living things think that what bees eat isn't the only thing that made so many different kinds of bees."
"Though volcanic eruptions emit carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, the atmospheric concentration of this gas is about 16000 times the amount released by volcanic eruptions; therefore, no matter how large a volcanic eruption is, it cannot produce a significant change in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Further, the total amount of carbon dioxide emitted per year by volcanic eruptions – between 130 and 230 million tons – is roughly equivalent to that emitted in only three to five days of human activity.","Volcanoes send out a gas called carbon dioxide. They send out less of this gas than people do. They don't change the amount of this gas in the air too much. Every year, volcanoes release between 130 and 230 million big bags of this gas. People send out the same amount in just three to five days."
"Most of Werner's metaphorical moments were painterly - the juxtaposing of the wild bird and the tame tree, the shimmer of the periwinkle, the splurt of titanium white that fell from it onto the pavement. He loved New York for its simple surprises, although in truth, Oregon and Iowa and Arizona and everywhere else had simple surprises as well. Cantaloupe-colored sunrises, banded cows, Dairy Queens, all kinds of things that didn't include black plastic mountains of trash and the smell of dog urine.","Werner created pictures with secret meanings. He depicted a free-spirited bird and a peaceful tree side by side. He illustrated a tiny, bright blue bloom glowing. He portrayed white color dripping onto the ground. Werner enjoyed New York for its unexpected events. He believed places like Oregon, Iowa, and Arizona held their own unexpected moments. He witnessed skies painted orange at dawn. He spotted cows with lines on them. He discovered stores that offered frozen desserts. He came across these sights near large piles of garbage. He also caught the scent of dog urine."
"The Times, in a welcome but highly uncharacteristic embrace of anarchy, celebrated this development as an ingenious guerrilla tactic in youth's eternal war against adult authority-""a bit of techno-jujitsu,"" as the paper put it. But it's not entirely clear which side is the winner here. When you hear the tone, it apparently sets your teeth on edge, which means that, if the entire class suddenly grimaces, it's a good bet that one of the students just got a text message.","The article enjoyed when clever children challenged grown-ups' control. The mess made them laugh. They called it ""tech fights."" It's not easy to tell who comes out on top. If there's a lot of noise and sad children, it probably means someone gave a serious heads-up."
"And finally, for most Americans, the War of Imagination - built of nationalistic excitement and ideological hubris and administration pronouncements about ""spreading democracy"" and ""greetings with sweets and flowers,"" and then about ""dead-enders"" and ""turning points,"" and finally about ""staying the course"" and refusing to ""cut and run"" -began, under the pressure of nearly three thousand American dead and perhaps a hundred thousand or more dead Iraqis, to give way to grim reality.","A lot of people from the United States wanted to share their ideas about how to lead a country. They believed that people would welcome them happily with treats and plants. They learned about courageous individuals and major shifts. They were advised to wait calmly and not leave. But the fight didn't turn out the way they expected. Close to 3,000 people from the United States lost their lives. It's possible that more than 100,000 people from Iraq lost their lives as well."
"In the last hundred years intellectual advances of science and politics have in like fashion been crystallized into material of instruction and now resist further change. I would not say that the spirit of teaching is hostile to that of liberal inquiry, but a philosophy which exists largely as something to be taught rather than wholly as something to be reflected upon is conducive to discussion of views held by others rather than to immediate response. Philosophy when taught inevitably magnifies the history of past thought, and leads professional philosophers to approach their subject-matter through its formulation in received systems. ","Schools and leaders have been paying attention to studying for a long time. They don't like to change. Studying doesn't block fresh thoughts. However, if thinking hard is only for studying, it just brings back old ideas. It doesn't help with coming up with new thoughts. Instructors who think a lot usually concentrate on ideas from before. This causes smart people to look at their topics in the same old ways."
"It was the preliminary dwarfing and deliquescence of the mature old beside the embryonic mass of the new. It was impossible then—it is, I believe, only beginning to be possible now—to estimate the proportions, possibilities, and inter-relations of the new social orders out of which a social organization has still to be built in the coming years. No formula of definite reconstruction had been evolved, or has even been evolved yet, after a hundred years.","The old got smaller and rotted next to the new. The new was just starting. It was tough to figure out the new ways of being together. We have to figure out how people can get along with these new ways. There was no definite idea to fix society. Even after a hundred years, there's still no idea."
"We are never so apt to lose our sense of proportion as when we consider those beloved writers whom we hold to be humourists because they have made us laugh. It may be conceded that, as a people, we have an abiding and somewhat disquieting sense of fun. We are nimble of speech, we are more prone to levity than to seriousness, we are able to recognize a vital truth when it is presented to us under the familiar aspect of a jest, and we habitually allow ourselves certain forms of exaggeration, accepting, perhaps unconsciously, Hazlitt's verdict: ""Lying is a species of wit, and shows spirit and invention.""","We often don't remember when we make smart decisions. Writers can make us giggle. We enjoy laughing in the way that suits us. We talk quickly and prefer funny stories over serious ones. We have awesome thoughts, even if they make us chuckle. We might make things sound bigger than they are. We could think the same as Hazlitt. He believed that being clever in a tricky way can be a sign of being inventive."
"The stage in these volumes presents itself indeed not merely as a mirror of life, but as an illustration of the utmost intensity of life, in the fortunes and characters of the players. Ups and downs, generosity, dark fates, the most delicate goodness, have nowhere been more prominent than in the private existence of those devoted to the public mimicry of men and women. Contact with the stage, almost throughout its history, presents itself as a kind of touchstone, to bring out the bizarrerie, the theatrical tricks and contrasts, of the actual world.",These books tell about the lives of people who pretend to be others in movies or plays. They share their happy and tough moments. These people have times when they say goodbye and feel down. They do nice things and look out for people. Pretending to be someone else can make them act weird or tricky. It shows things that don't happen every day.
"It is this salutary organ of the will of all which establishes, in civil right, the natural equality between men. It is this celestial voice which dictates to each citizen the precepts of public reason, and teaches him to act according to the rules of his own judgment, and not to behave inconsistently with himself. It is with this voice alone that political rulers should speak when they command; for no sooner does one man, setting aside the law, claim to subject another to his private will, than he departs from the state of civil society, and confronts him face to face in the pure state of nature, in which obedience is prescribed solely by necessity.","This part is about what everyone needs. It's fair to everyone. It's like getting help from someone who knows a lot. It shows you to believe in what you think. It makes you want to tell the truth. Bosses should think about these tips when making choices. If someone doesn't pay attention to the rules and bosses others around, they're not playing fair with the team. They behave crazily, as if there are no rules. People only follow them when they really have no other choice."
"Evolutionary psychology takes as its starting point the uncontroversial assertion that the anatomical and physiological features of the human brain have arisen as a result of adaptations to the demands of the environment over the millennia. However, from this reasonable point of departure, these psychologists make unreasonable extrapolations. They claim that the behavior of contemporary man (in almost all its aspects) is a reflection of features of the brain that acquired their present characteristics during those earliest days of our species when early man struggled to survive and multiply.","Our brains changed over time to fix old issues. People who know a lot believe these changes are a big deal. They think the way we act now is because of these changes. Long ago, people had to stay alive and have babies."
"In regard to propaganda the early advocates of universal literacy and a free press envisaged only two possibilities: the propaganda might be true, or it might be false. They did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in our Western capitalist democracies - the development of a vast mass communications industry, concerned in the main neither with the true nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant. In a word, they failed to take into account man's almost infinite appetite for distractions.",People enjoyed having books for all and free news. They weren't concerned about made-up stories or slanted news. They didn't think a big business would come from unimportant stuff. But this business got really big because making money mattered. They didn't think people would care so much about things that took their mind off serious topics.
"There must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions and the structural adaptations of the organism, and, since the conditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the adaptations must be called forth by the conditions. The selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it enables us to understand that there is a continual production of what is non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive alone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of arising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.","Living things change to fit where they live. They don't pick these changes. The world around them helps the best changes stick around. These changes are random. Only the changes that work well last. A long time ago, a man named Empedocles talked about this."
"As their name suggests, rare collectibles are scarce, hard to find items. They can be antiques that are desirable because of their age, type of craftsmanship or some other unique feature that represents the past. Some rare collectibles are so old that they are considered to be antiquities - artifacts of an ancient civilization such as ancient Greek or ancient Chinese society. Alternatively, rare collectibles can be of very recent origin, sometimes being only a few years old. The common denominator of all rare collectibles, no matter what their type or age, is rarity. Frequently, because of their scarcity and their appeal, rare collectibles are also valuable. ","Hard-to-find special things are loved by many. Folks enjoy gathering them. They're into things that are old, really well-made, or one-of-a-kind. Some special things come from places like old Greece or China. Others aren't that old. These things aren't everywhere. They're worth a lot because they're not easy to find and lots of people want them."
"Therefore, though the situation seems dark in the context of the confrontation between the superpowers, the silver lining is provided by amazing phenomenon that the very nations which have spent incalculable resources and energy for the production of deadly weapons are desperately trying to find out how they might never be used. They threaten each other, intimidate each other and go to the brink, but before the total hour arrives they withdraw from the brink.",Big powerful countries make each other feel nervous. They have lots of dangerous tools for fighting. They work hard to stop themselves from using these tools. This work is important. They scare each other. They come close to fighting. They stay away from a huge battle.
"Irrespective of how small these differences might be, they are crucial, and the disequilibrium is maintained by air near the surface mixing with air higher up, which is typically appreciably cooler and lower in water vapor content. The turbulence, which takes its energy from the wind mixes the air. As the speed of wind increases, so does the turbulence, and consequently the rate of heat and moisture transfer. We can arrive at a detailed understanding of this phenomenon after further study. The transfer of momentum from wind to water, which occurs when waves are formed is an interacting-and complicated phenomenon.","The air near the ground blends with chillier air from up high. This blending makes the air wild and messy. Even small changes matter a lot. Wind stirs the air around. When the wind is stronger, it stirs the air faster. This helps warmth and wetness move quickly. We're going to learn more about this. Wind and water work together to create ripples or waves. They help each other in this tricky job. The wind shoves the water around."
"The interconnectedness of brain and body has tantalizing implications for our ability to both understand and treat illness. If some brain conditions start outside the brain, then perhaps therapies for them could also reach in from outside. Treatments that take effect through the digestive system, heart or other organs, for instance, would be much easier and less invasive to administer than those that must cross the blood–brain barrier, the brain’s first line of defence against pathogens and other insults from the body.","Our body and head work together to make us better when we feel bad. When something is wrong with our body, it can affect our head. Helping our belly or heart get better can solve these problems. This help is usually easy. Our head has a protector that stops bad stuff."
"The French are certainly misunderstood: — but whether the fault is theirs, in not sufficiently explaining themselves, or speaking with that exact limitation and precision which one would expect on a point of such importance, and which, moreover, is so likely to be contested by us — or whether the fault may not be altogether on our side, in not understanding their language always so critically as to know “what they would be at” — I shall not decide; but ‘tis evident to me, when they affirm, “That they who have seen Paris, have seen every thing,” they must mean to speak of those who have seen it by day-light.","Understanding French people can be tricky. They might talk in complicated ways. We might also not be good at French. They say, ""If you see Paris, you've seen it all."" They mean Paris is great during the day when the sun is shining."
"But it was the figure you cut as an employee, on an employee’s footing with the girls, in work clothes, and being of that tin-tough, creaking, jazzy bazaar of hardware, glassware, chocolate, chicken-feed, jewelry, drygoods, oilcloth, and song hits—that was the big thing; and even being the Atlases of it, under the floor, hearing how the floor bore up under the ambling weight of hundreds, with the fanning, breathing movie organ next door and the rumble descending from the trolleys on Chicago Avenue—the bloody-rinded Saturday gloom of wind-borne ash, and blackened forms of five-storey buildings rising up to a blind Northern dimness from the Christmas blaze of shops.","You put in effort just like other girls getting ready for work. You were in a noisy, packed place where they sold tools, cups, candy, food for birds, shiny adornments, materials, water-resistant textiles, and popular music. It was an important spot. You were as reliable as the strong parts supporting a structure. You heard the sound of someone walking on the level above. Music from a keyboard instrument was playing close by. You heard powered city transport vehicles on a street in Chicago. You thought back to boring weekends filled with dust. The high structures looked less interesting next to the vivid lights of the vacation store."
"The streets are paved now, and the telephone and electric companies are cutting down more and more of the shade trees–the water oaks, the maples and locusts and elms–to make room for iron poles bearing clusters of bloated and ghostly and bloodless grapes, and we have a city laundry which makes the rounds on Monday morning, gathering the bundles of clothes into bright-colored, specially-made motor cars: the soiled wearing of a whole week now flees apparitionlike behind alert and irritable electric horns, with a long diminishing noise of rubber and asphalt like tearing silk, and even the Negro women who still take in white people’s washing after the old custom, fetch and deliver it in automobiles.","They made the roads flat. Companies that give us phone service and power chopped down trees. Those trees made areas cooler and less sunny. They installed big, steel posts. Lots of cables are attached to these posts. A washing service picks up outfits at the start of the week. They drive bright, loud vehicles. These vehicles beep often. Women with deep-colored complexions also drive. They gather and bring back clean clothes."
The defoliation of millions of acres of trees by massive infestations of gypsy moth caterpillars is a recurring phenomenon in the northeastern United States.,"Caterpillars from a type of moth called gypsy like to munch on leaves from trees. They do this a lot, especially in the top right part of the United States. Because of this, lots of trees there end up with no leaves at all."
"Forest stands of red oaks, with their tannin-rich foliage, may even provide caterpillars with safe havens from disease.",Big trees with strong wood have leaves that taste bad. These bad-tasting parts stop little crawly bugs from getting sick and help them stay well.
"Although a historical lack of access to formal Spanish-language education initially limited the opportunities of some Chicanos to hone their skills as writers of Spanish, their bilingual culture clearly fostered an exuberant and compelling oral tradition.",Some people with Mexican roots who live in America didn't learn Spanish at school. They found it hard to improve their Spanish writing. They used both English and Spanish a lot when they talked. They got really good at telling stories.
"Works in English, however, often required the elimination of nuance or colloquialism, the adoption of a formal tone, and the adjustment of themes or ideas to satisfy the different demands of national publications.",Writers often remove tiny bits and easy words. They use tricky language. They switch topics and thoughts. They do this to make English book companies happy.
"Researchers reasoned that low-frequency sound waves, because they are so well described mathematically and because even small perturbations in emitted sound waves can be detected, could be transmitted through the ocean over many different paths and that the properties of the ocean's interior could be deduced on the basis of how the ocean altered the signals.",Researchers wanted to make deep sounds travel through the sea. These sounds use simple number patterns. Folks can notice tiny differences in these sounds. The researchers aimed to learn about the sea floor by looking at how the sounds changed.
"In medical tomography x-rays map the human body's density variations (and hence internal organs); the information from the x-rays, transmitted through the body along many different paths, is recombined to form three-dimensional images of the body's interior.","Medical experts use a special picture-taking device to look into your body. They can check out your breathing organs and heart. This device shines a special kind of light. It snaps photos from various directions. These photos are put together to make a picture that looks like it has depth, like real life."
"Ironically, now that photography is securely established as a fine art, many photographers find it pretentious or irrelevant to label it as such.",Taking pictures is a big deal. Lots of people who take photos don't think it's right to call it a fancy kind of art.
"Serious photographers variously claim to be finding, recording, impartially observing, witnessing events, exploring themselves-anything but making works of art.",Photographers put in a lot of effort. They search for stuff to take pictures of. They snap photos of different spots. They observe happenings without taking sides. They discover more about who they are. They don't claim to make art.
"This method of pumping heat from one place to another served mankind well when refrigerators' main jobs were preserving food and, as air conditioners, cooling buildings.",This way moves warmth. It helps food stay good in fridges. It makes rooms chilly with cool-air blowers.
"They are based on a robust and effective idea--draw heat from the thing you want to cool by evaporating a liquid next to it, and then dump that heat by pumping the vapour elsewhere and condensing it.","They have a clever idea to make things less hot. The idea changes a wet substance into an airy form. This airy form soaks up the warmth. After that, the airy form is shifted and changed back into a wet substance. The warmth is let go in a different place."
One set of candidates are known as paraelectric materials.,Some items let electricity flow through them. You can pick these items to use.
"An array of tiny pieces of paraelectric material can sense the heat radiated by, for example, a person, and the pattern of the array's electrical outputs can then be used to construct an image.",Tiny parts can feel warmth from a body. They create tiny zaps of energy. These zaps make a picture.
"One consequence of Moore's Law, which describes the doubling of the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months, is that the amount of heat produced doubles as well.","Every year and a half, the tiny parts inside a computer chip double in number. This causes the chip to heat up more."
"And the idea of shifting from single-core processors to systems that divided processing power between first two, and then four, subunits, in order to spread the thermal load, also seems to have the end of the road in sight.","Computers are starting to use two or four tiny parts instead of just one. This helps to share out the warmth. But, this way of doing things is almost as far as it can go."
"The trick to a good thermoelectric material is a crystal structure in which electrons can flow freely, but the path of phonons--heat-carrying vibrations that are larger than electrons--is constantly interrupted. In practice, this trick is hard to pull off, and thermoelectric materials are thus less efficient than paraelectric ones (or, at least, than those examined by Dr Mischenko).",A stuff changes warmth into electric power. It should allow very small bits of electric energy to move without trouble. It should stop very small bits of warmth from getting through. This isn't easy. These kinds of stuff aren't the greatest for jobs that use electric power. Dr. Mischenko found out about this.
"Shy of competition, eager for artificially high prices, they are helping to block the efficient generation, transmission and distribution of energy on the continent.",They don't compete with others. They enjoy expensive things. They halt creating and spreading good vibes in Europe.
"Companies that dominate national markets have, so far, had little interest in improving the interconnections which would mean lower prices for consumers across the continent.","Stores are all over the country. They don't work on making their relationships better. If they did, people buying things all over could pay less."
"The European Commission, which on the same day presented its recommendation for improving EU energy policy, also wants to see the unbundling of ownership, the legal separation of energy suppliers and transporters, something that the integrated energy companies and interested governments, notably in France and Germany, are bound to oppose ferociously.",The people in charge in the EU suggested changes to how we handle energy. They want to separate the companies that give us energy from the ones that help move it around. This will make the big energy companies less powerful. Big energy companies and some important people in France and Germany might not like this idea.
The risk is that concerns about security of supply may be used spuriously by those in Europe who oppose the sort of liberalisation encouraged by Ms Kroes.,People in Europe don't like what Ms. Kroes is saying. They're afraid it could make it harder to get stuff.
"Protection has been tried for long enough and evidently has not worked for the internal market, nor have these companies secured the best deals for consumers from the Russians.",Stores close to us are feeling the pain because of new safety rules. These stores couldn't have low prices. The low prices were expected to be from products made in Russia.
"All that is laudable enough, but will also require political horse-trading as governments Europe's leaders are due to meet in March to discuss the various energy proposals try to avoid commitments that may hurt domestic energy companies or make European firms less competitive than rivals in America, Asia and elsewhere.",Leaders from countries in Europe will have a meeting in March. They will discuss new ways to use energy. They want to keep their energy businesses safe. They aim to make their businesses as powerful as the ones in America and Asia. They will agree on some things and give up on others to reach this goal.
"Achieving either target would mean promoting cleaner cars, a more effective emissions-trading system for Europe, wider use of public transport and a sharp increase in the use of renewable sources of energy, like wind and solar power.",Leaders should help make cars less polluting. They should improve the system that lets companies limit air pollution in Europe. They should promote riding more on buses and trains. They should boost the use of energy from the sun and the wind.
"If successful, virus therapy could eventually form a third pillar alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the standard arsenal against cancer, while avoiding some of the debilitating side-effects.",Tiny bugs can help fight a serious illness. This help might use powerful light rays and healing drugs. It might make you feel less ill.
Cancer-killing viruses exploit the fact that cancer cells suppress the body's local immune system.,The viruses break down the cancer. They use a special method.
"Prof Seymour's innovative solution is to mask the virus from the body's immune system, effectively allowing the viruses to do what chemotherapy drugs do - spread through the blood and reach tumours wherever they are.",Teacher Seymour has a new idea. He aims to trick the body's protection system. The protection system won't fight the virus. The virus will move smoothly through the body. This is similar to how cancer treatments work. The virus will go after the cancer cells in the blood.
"After the stealth virus infects the tumour, it replicates, but the copies do not have the chemical modifications.",A tiny bug gets into a small raised spot. It makes a twin of itself. It continues to make more twins.
"Two viruses are likely to be examined in the first clinical trials: adenovirus, which normally causes a cold-like illness, and vaccinia, which causes cowpox and is also used in the vaccine against smallpox.",The first tests on people will likely try out two tiny germs. The adenovirus usually gives people stuffy noses and sneezes. Vaccinia is the germ that gives cows a disease with sores but it's also used to make the shot that protects against smallpox.
"For years European economies had been lagging dismally behind America (to say nothing of Asia), but in 2006 the large continental economies had one of their best years for a decade, briefly outstripping America in terms of growth.","In 2006, Europe's large economies got better. They performed better than they had in the last ten years. For some time, they expanded more quickly than the economy of the United States."
"Every four or five years, European countries take a large stride towards further integration by signing a new treaty: the Maastricht treaty in 1992, the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997, the Treaty of Nice in 2001.","Countries in Europe decide to work together better and they make new rules to do this from time to time. In 1992, they all agreed on a set of rules called the Maastricht Rules. Then in 1997, they came up with another set called the Amsterdam Rules. By 2001, they agreed on yet another set called the Nice Rules."
"And in 2005 they were supposed to ratify a European constitution, laying the ground for yet more integration until the calm rhythm was rudely shattered by French and Dutch voters.","In 2005, there were new rules to bring European countries together. But, people in France and the Netherlands said no to these rules."
"Government leaders have already agreed to celebrate it ceremoniously, restating their commitment to 'ever closer union' and the basic ideals of European unity.",Country leaders chose to have a great party. They promised to work together better. They also showed a lot of support for Europe's plan to be more united.
But it does not take a Machiavelli to spot that once governments have signed the declaration (and it seems unlikely anyone would be so uncollegiate as to veto it) they will already be halfway towards committing themselves to a new treaty.,Governments will say yes to the deal. People think they will say it's okay. They give their word to stick to a new plan. The plan is simple to get.
"Neoclassical economics is built on the assumption that humans are rational beings who have a clear idea of their best interests and strive to extract maximum benefit (or 'utility', in economist-speak) from any situation.",People in neoclassical economics are seen as clever decision-makers. It suggests that individuals know what's best for themselves. It explains that people aim to gain the most advantage from their decisions.
"According to the German government which holds the EU's agenda-setting presidency during the first half of 2007, there will be a new draft of a slimmed-down constitution ready by the middle of the year, perhaps to put to voters, perhaps not.",Germany will be in charge of the group of European countries until the summer of 2007. They plan to create a simpler set of important rules by that time. They might let people vote to hear what they think about the new rules.
"Then, according to bureaucratic planners in Brussels and Berlin, blithely ignoring the possibility of public rejection, the whole thing will be signed, sealed and a new constitution delivered in 2009-10.",Leaders from Brussels and Berlin will make new guidelines in 2009-10. They aren't considering potential arguments.
"UK and Australian health agencies have released information about 240 cases of odd occurrences, including sleepwalking, amnesia and hallucinations among people taking the drug zolpidem.","In the UK and Australia, health groups reported that 240 individuals became unwell. They had taken the sleeping pill zolpidem. This led to them walking in their sleep, forgetting things, and seeing things that weren't there."
"While doctors say that zolpidem can offer much-needed relief for people with sleep disorders, they caution that these newly reported cases should prompt a closer look at its possible side effects.",Health experts recommend using zolpidem to help you sleep. They warn you to be careful because it can have some unwanted effects. This advice comes after some recent problems were reported.
"The newly reported cases in the UK and Australia add to a growing list of bizarre sleepwalking episodes linked to the drug in other countries, including reports of people sleep-driving while on the medication.",New stories from the UK and Australia show a connection between weird actions and a drug. People are walking and even driving while they're asleep after using it. These new things happening are unexpected reactions to the drug.
The drug is a benzodiazepine-like hypnotic that promotes deep sleep by interacting with brain receptors for a chemical called gamma-aminobutyric acid.,A pill you take to help you sleep changes how some areas in your brain work. These areas control a thing called gamma-aminobutyric acid.
"The product information for prescribers advises that psychiatric adverse effects, including hallucinations, sleepwalking and nightmares, are more likely in the elderly, and treatment should be stopped if they occur.","The guide that comes with the thing warns that it might make old people see things that aren't there, walk in their sleep, or have really bad dreams. If any of these issues happen, a medical expert should end the treatment."
Patient advocacy groups say they would like government health agencies and drug companies to take a closer look at the possible risks associated with sleep medicines.,Organizations help people who are ill. They make words easy to understand. They point out who is doing something.
"Millions of people have taken the drug without experiencing any strange side effects, points out Richard Millman at Brown Medical School, director of the Sleep Disorders Center of Lifespan Hospitals in Providence, Rhode Island, US.","Richard Millman has a job at a place where they teach doctors. He is in charge of a place where they study sleep. This place is part of hospitals that look after people for their whole lives. It's located in Providence, a city in Rhode Island, in the United States. He mentions that lots of people used the medicine and nothing strange happened to them."
"The Guardian has learned that the FSA will launch a series of 10-second television adverts in January telling shoppers how to follow a red, amber and green traffic light labelling system on the front of food packs, which is designed to tackle Britain's obesity epidemic.","A news company found out about short TV ads that will start showing in January. A group that cares about food being safe is making these ads. The ads will show people who buy things at the store how to understand nutrition labels. These labels use red, yellow, and green colors and are stuck on food wrappers. The goal is to talk about the problem of too many people being overweight in the UK."
"The industry is planning a major marketing campaign for a competing labelling system which avoids colour-coding in favour of information about the percentage of ""guideline daily amounts"" (GDAs) of fat, salt and sugar contained in their products.","The industry is getting ready for a big event to advertise their stuff. They are showing a new way to tell you what's in their products. This way, you can see how much fat, salt, and sugar is in them. It makes sure it's okay with what experts say you should have every day."
"Sources at the TV regulators are braced for a legal challenge from the industry and have described the lobbying efforts to block any new ad ban or colour-coded labelling as ""the most ferocious we've ever experienced"".",People who create TV guidelines believe TV businesses will resist new regulations. They claim these businesses work hard to prevent updates to commercials and caution messages.
"The FSA is understood to have briefed its ad agency, United, before Christmas, and will aim to air ads that are ""non-confrontational, humorous and factual"" as a counterweight to industry's efforts about the same time.","The Food Safety Group had a chat with United, the company that helps them make commercials. They had this talk before the big winter break. Their goal is to create ads that are amusing, truthful, and nice. These commercials will be different from what other food companies show during that time."
"Ehrlich's model shows that whilst most of these oscillations cancel each other out, some reinforce one another and become long-lived temperature variations.","Ehrlich's thought is that usually when it gets warmer or cooler, it's no big deal. But sometimes, these little temperature changes come together. They can make the weather stay different for a long time."
"For example, if sea ice begins to form because of a slight cooling, carbon dioxide that would otherwise have found its way into the atmosphere as part of the carbon cycle is locked into the ice.","When the sea gets really chilly, it turns to ice. This ice captures a gas that normally escapes into the atmosphere."
"One such cycle describes the way Earth's orbit gradually changes shape from a circle to a slight ellipse and back again roughly every 100,000 years.","Every 100,000 years, the path Earth takes around the sun switches from being round like a ball to more stretched out like an egg."
"However, Edwards believes the small changes in solar heating produced by Milankovitch cycles are then amplified by feedback mechanisms on Earth.",Edwards believes that the Earth can make the tiny heating changes caused by Milankovitch cycles even stronger.
